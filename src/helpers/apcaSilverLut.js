 *     APCA: Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm. In public beta and
 *           subject to change. System for testing the perceptual
 *           readability of text based on its size, weight, color, and
 *           the background color for self-emitting screens. Being
 *           considered for WCAG 3.
 *  Silver+: APCA Conformance level (stricter than the "Bronze" version).
 *      LUT: Lookup Table.
 *      BoW: Dark colors on Light colors or "Black on White".
 *      WoB: Light colors on Dark colors or "White on Black".
 *       Lc: Lightness Contrast. Can be between 0 and Â±106. Positve
 *           numbers are for BoW, negative for WoB. The further from 0,
 *           the higher the perceptual contrast is.
 * Polarity: Conveying a difference based on BoW or WoB.
